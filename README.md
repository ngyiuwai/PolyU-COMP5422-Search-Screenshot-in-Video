Application to demonstrate basic elements in a Content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR) System. Written in Python.

## How to use?

**Report.pdf**:  A short survey to introduce CBIR and how it works. It briefly summarizes the classical survey papers.

**Demo.pdf**:  A tutorial on how to run the application. Also briefly introduces the techniques used.

If you are interested in the algorithm, please read comments in source code.

*Please note that it is a mini-project built in 3 weekends (2 weekends for reading papers + coding, 1 weekend for reports).*
*The application is not optimized in term of speed/ memory usage. It is only for the purpose of demonstrating basic elements in a CBIR System.*
